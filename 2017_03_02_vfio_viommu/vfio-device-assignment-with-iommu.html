<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
This page describes use cases for device assignment with vIOMMU.
</p>
<p>
This page will mostly talk about DMA protections that IOMMU/vIOMMU
provides. Besides that, IOMMU can provide further protections like
Interrupt Remapping (IR) in a similar way that DMA protections are
done. A well protected system will not only need DMA but also IRQ
protections.

<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Guest Device Assignment in General </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>  
Below picture shows a basic device assignment use case in QEMU.
</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="vfio-device-assignment-common.png"  alt="vfio-device-assignment-common.png" /></p>
<p>Device Assignment without vIOMMU</p>
</div>

<p>
Let's consider a generic <b>PCI device</b> above, which is a real hardware
attached to host system. The host can use generic kernel drivers to
drive the device. In that case, all the reads/writes of that device
will be protected by <b>host IOMMU</b>, which is safe. The <b>protected DMAs</b>
are shown in <i>green arrow</i>.
</p>
<p>
The PCI device can also be assigned to a guest. By leveraging <b>VFIO driver</b> in the host kernel, the device can be exclusively managed by
any userspace programs like QEMU. In the guest with assigned device,
we should be able to see exactly the same device just like in the host
(as shown in the <i>imaginary line</i>). Here, the hypervisor is capable of
modifying the device information, like capability bits, etc.. But
that's out of the scope of this page. By assigning the device to a
guest, we can have merely the same performance in guest comparing to
in the host.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, when the device is assigned to the guest, guest
memory address space is totally exposed to the hardware PCI device. So
there would have no protection when the device do DMAs to the guest
system, especially writes. Malicious writes can corrupt the guest in
no time. Those <b>unsafe DMAs</b> are shown with a <i>red arrow</i>.
</p>
<p>
That's why we need a vIOMMU in the guest.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Use Case 1: Guest Device Assignment with vIOMMU </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
To protect the guest memory from malicious assigned devices, we can
have vIOMMU in the guest, just like what host IOMMU does to the host.
Then the picture will be like:
</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="vfio-device-assignment-viommu.png"  alt="vfio-device-assignment-viommu.png" /></p>
<p>Device Assignment with vIOMMU</p>
</div>

<p>
In the above figure, the only difference is that we introduced guest
vIOMMU to do DMA protections. With that, guest DMAs are safe now.
</p>
<p>
Here, our use case targets at the guests that are using kernel
drivers. One thing to mention is that, currently, this use case can
have significant performance impact on the assigned device. The
dynamic allocation of guest IOVA mapping will cause lots of work in
the hypervisor in order to sync the shadow page table with the real
hardware. However, in cases where the memory mapping is static, there
should not have a significant impact on the performance (DPDK is one
use case, which I'll mention specifically in the next chapter). With
the general case of dynamic memory mapping, more work is needed to
further reduce the negative impact that the protection has brought.

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Use Case 2: Guest Device Assignment with vIOMMU - DPDK Scenario </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>  
DPDK (the so-called DataPlan Development Kit) is vastly used in high
performance scenarios, which moved the kernel space drivers into
userspace for the sake of even better performance. Normally, the DPDK
program can run directly inside a bare metal to achieve the best
performance with specific hardware. Meanwhile, it can also be run
inside guest to drive either an assigned device from host, or an
emulated device like virtio ones.
</p>
<p>
For the guest DPDK use case mentioned, host can still continue
leveraging DPDK to maximum the packet delivery in the virtual
switches. OVS-DPDK is a good example.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, DPDK introduced a problem that since we cannot really
trust any userspace application program, we cannot trust DPDK
applications as well, especially if it can have full access to the
system memory via the hardware and taint the kernel address space.
Here vIOMMU protects not only the malicious devices like hardware
errors, it also protects guest from buggy userspace drivers like DPDK
(via VFIO driver in the guest).
</p>
<p>
Actually there are at least three ways that DPDK applications can
manage a device in the userspace (and these methods are mostly general
as well not limited to DPDK use cases):
</p>
<ul>
<li>VFIO
</li>
<li>VFIO no-iommu mode
</li>
<li>UIO
</li>
</ul>


<p>
UIO is going to be obsolete since its lacking of features and
unsafety.
</p>
<p>
Let's consider a use case with guest DPDK application with two PCI
devices. To clarify the difference of above methods, I used different
ways to assign the device to the DPDK applications:
</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="vfio-device-assignment-dpdk.png"  alt="vfio-device-assignment-dpdk.png" /></p>
<p>Device Assignment with vIOMMU - DPDK Scenario</p>
</div>

<p>
In above case, <b>PCI Device 1</b> and <b>PCI Device 2</b> are two devices that
are assigned to guest DPDK applications. In the host, both of the
devices are assigned to guest using kernel VFIO driver (here we cannot
use either "VFIO no-iommu mode" or "UIO", the reason behind is out of
the scope of this page though :). While in the guest, when we assign
devices to DPDK applications, we can use one of the three methods
mentioned above. However, only if we assign device with generic VFIO
driver (which <i>requires</i> a vIOMMU) could we get a safely assigned
device. Either assigning the device by "UIO" or "VFIO no-iommu mode"
is unsafe.
</p>
<p>
In our case, <b>PCI Device 1</b> is <b>safe</b>, while <b>PCI Device 2</b> is <b>unsafe</b>.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Use Case 3: Nested Guest Device Assignment </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">


<p>
Another use case that device assignment with vIOMMU would help is that
nested device assignment will work just like magic with it.
</p>
<p>
As we have mentioned in the first section, an IOMMU is required for
device assignment to work. Here, to assign a L1 guest device to a L2
guest, we also need a vIOMMU inside L1 guest to build up the page
mappings required for device assignment work. 
</p>
<p>
Nested device assignment looks like:
