This is Peter Xu's home page.  Here're some old pages before I migrate to the
new sites:

* A game written in Common Lisp, called [starwar][starwar-home].
* A [write-up][vfio-viommu] about VFIO device assignment with vIOMMU.
* Some silly write-ups that I didn't even know why I wrote... [0][l0][1][l1][2][l2]
