I'm Peter Xu and I'm a software engineer.  I was born in Beijing, however
recently I live in Toronto.  I worked on storage initially for a few years,
then (until now) I have been employed by Red Hat virtualization team.  You can
find my email at the bottom of the page.  Feel free to drop me an email for
anything.

Btw, my Chinese name is "徐哲", pronounced as "Xu Zhe".  It's not easy to
pronounce, I know, I know.  So just call me Peter. :-)

Most of my code clips are stored (currently) at [github][github-xzpeter].  Feel
free to have a look too.
